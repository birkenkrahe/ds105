        "1.  What is data science?\n\n>    - Use data to better describe the present, predict or prescribe the\n>      future.\n>    - Interdisciplinary field that uses algorithms, data and math to\n>      extract insights from structured and unstructured data.\n>    - The \"sexiest job of the 21st century\"2. Is the [Tesla test drive with Elon Musk](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/elon-musk-shows-fsd-beta-v12-live-test-drive-on-x) (Aug 26, 2023) an example\n   for a \"data science application\"? \n\n1.  Describe the data science workflow.\n\n>    1) Data collection and storage  [data import]\n>    2) Data preparation [data wrangling]\n>    3) Data exploration and visualization [data modeling]\n>    4) Experimentation and prediction [+ data storytelling]\n> \n>    [From the DataCamp blog:](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-data-science-the-definitive-guide?irclickid=0a2UQaStbxyNWhXRYE2FCwsmUkFyUrU-NVpDxo0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=000000_1-1310690_2-mix_3-all_4-na_5-na_6-na_7-mp_8-affl-ip_9-na_10-bau_11-Admitad%20-%201310690&utm_content=TEXT_LINK&utm_term=442763)\n>    #+attr<sub>latex</sub>: :width 400px\n>    ![img](../img/datascience.png) 4. What does 'deep learning' refer to?\n>    A subfield of machine learning, which relies on large\n>    (i.e. multi-layered) neural networks.\n>    #+attr<sub>latex</sub>: :width 400px\n>    ![img](../img/gpt.png)5. Which job roles exist in data science and what do they mean?\n>    1. Data wrangling: data engineer (SQL, cloud, Linux)\n>    2. Data analytics: data analyst (SQL, R, dashboards)\n>    3. Data modeling: data scientist (R, SQL, stats, machine learning)\n>    4. Deep learning: ML scientist (NLP, LLMs, Python)6. Which ways do you know to program and run R?\n>    - As a shell from the command line with `R` (or `Rterm`)\n>    - As a REPL in replit.com (editor, console, terminal, PDF)\n>    - As an IDE with the command `Rgui` on your PC\n>    - As an IDE with RStudio on your PC or in the cloud\n>    - As an IDE in Emacs + ESS + Org-mode (advanced only)7. What's special about R?\n>    - Statistical programming language with great graphics\n>    - Open source and easy to expand\n>    - Easy to learn especially for non-technical people\n>    - Large community8. Which R functions do you remember? (6)\n\n    data\n    ls()\n    help\n    head\n    plot\n    q[uit]()\n\n1.  What is the \"formula\" notation?\n\n>    Refers to the use of `~` for x and y arguments in certain R functions\n>    like `plot` where you can call `plot(x,y)` or `plot(y~x)`.10. When can you connect the points in a scatterplot?\n>     When the points are ordered in some way - for example when the\n>     data represent a time series (see `Nile`).\n\n"
