1. What is data science?
   #+begin_quote
   - Use data to better describe the present, predict or prescribe the
     future.
   - Interdisciplinary field that uses algorithms, data and math to
     extract insights from structured and unstructured data.
   - The "sexiest job of the 21st century"
   #+end_quote
2. Is the [[https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/elon-musk-shows-fsd-beta-v12-live-test-drive-on-x][Tesla test drive with Elon Musk]] (Aug 26, 2023) an example
   for a "data science application"?
3. Describe the data science workflow.
   #+begin_quote
   1) Data collection and storage  [data import]
   2) Data preparation [data wrangling]
   3) Data exploration and visualization [data modeling]

   #+end_quote
5. Which job roles exist in data science and what do they mean?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Data wrangling: data engineer (SQL, cloud, Linux)
   2. Data analytics: data analyst (SQL, R, dashboards)
   3. Data modeling: data scientist (R, SQL, stats, machine learning)
   4. Deep learning: ML scientist (NLP, LLMs, Python > R)
   #+end_quote
6. Which ways do you know to program and run R?
   #+begin_quote
   - As a shell from the command line with ~R~ (or ~Rterm~)
   - As a REPL in replit.com (editor, console, terminal, PDF)
   - As an IDE with the command ~Rgui~ on your PC
   - As an IDE with RStudio on your PC or in the cloud
   - As an IDE in Emacs + ESS + Org-mode (advanced only)
   #+end_quote
7. What's special about R?
   #+begin_quote
   - Statistical programming language with great graphics
   - Open source and easy to expand
   - Easy to learn especially for non-technical people
   - Large community
   #+end_quote
8. Which R functions do you remember? (6)
   #+begin_example R
   data
   ls()
   help
   head
   plot
   q[uit]()
   #+end_example
9. What is the "formula" notation?
   #+begin_quote
   Refers to the use of ~~~ for x and y arguments in certain R functions
   like ~plot~ where you can call ~plot(x,y)~ or ~plot(y~x)~.
   #+end_quote
10. When can you connect the points in a scatterplot?
    #+begin_quote
    When the points are ordered in some way - for example when the
    data represent a time series (see ~Nile~).
    #+end_quote

** Week 2 preview

- Datacamp Workspace: simple and extended example.
- Exercise: import, view and plot the ~Nile~ data.
- Lecture: What is data science?

** Test 1 is live (complete by Sept 3, 11:59 pm)

- The test is available online, you've got 30 minutes
- It's an open book test: use any help you can get
- Gradebook in Canvas is updated automatically

* Mon-28-Aug

- DataCamp review: data pipeline; job roles in data science
- Simple ~mtcars~ example in DataCamp workspace.
- Parameters in R functions, e.g. ~n~ in ~head(data, n=3)~.
- Plotting ~Nile~ data with ~plot(Nile)~ produces a line plot, choosing
  the parameter ~type="p"~ changes it to a scatterplot.
- Computing a trendline through points using ~lm~ (linear regression
  model), and drawing a colored line with ~abline~.

* Wed-30-Aug

- For the first sprint review, try to identify a topic and/or a
  dataset, and work through the criteria of the Canvas assignment.
- ~plot()~ is an example of a 'generic function' - no matter what data
  structures or types you throw at it, it'll produce a plot.
- In DataCamp workspace, you can edit your notebook using Jupyter Lab:
  this gives you access to a launcher with file editor and a terminal;
  you can now create a .R file in the editor, and run it with ~Rterm~ in
  the terminal.
- The notebook has text cells, which allow insertion of links and
  images using markup notation.

* Fri-1-Sep

- How to download a CSV file to the PC
- How to establish an absolute or relative path to the file (on PC)
- How to read the CSV file into a data frame
- How to store the data frame in a variable
- How to check the structure of the data frame
- How to extract values from the data frame

- Adding your project idea to Canvas (pages)

* Fri-8-Sep

** Review DataCamp session

1) What's an event log, for example for web data? How many features
   does it have?
   #+begin_quote
   An identifier, a description of the event, and a timestamp
   #+end_quote
2) Open your R scratchbook, load these data into a dataframe and tell
   me how many columns and rows the data have - use only ONE line:
   [[https://tinyurl.com/flightEventLogCsv][tinyurl.com/flightEventLogCsv]]
   #+begin_src R
     str(read.csv("../data/flight_event_log.csv",header=TRUE))
   #+end_src
3) What can you do with the Twitter API?
   #+begin_quote
   Extract tweets from Twitter for further analysis or to build an
   application - here are [[https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/][examples]] from the early days of X (2009).
   #+end_quote
4) Does OpenAI have an API? What could you do with it?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, and you could use it to get access to ChatGPT and build an AI
   application ([[https://platform.openai.com/overview][overview]]).
   #+end_quote
5) Are social network data quantitative or qualitative data?
   #+begin_quote
   Can be both: number of people logging in (quantitative), or
   sentiments expressed in a social media post (qualitative). For
   computational (=numerical) analysis, you need to convert
   qualitative into quantitative data.
   #+end_quote
6) Is a social network graph like shown below an example of
   quantitative or qualitative data?
   #+attr_latex: :width 400px
   #+caption: https://www-cdn.nebula-graph.io/nebula-website-5.0/images/blogs/nebulagraph-sns/graph-database-on-social-network-03.jpeg
   [[../img/social_network_graph.jpeg]]
   #+begin_quote
   Both! the node image represents a quality (type of account), while
   the graph itself represents a collection of nodes or vertices and
   edges or links, which can be represented as an edge list:
   [(1,2),(2,3)] means that node 1 is connected with node 2 and node 2
   is connected with node 3.
   #+end_quote
7) What languages do you use to query databases?
   #+begin_quote
   NoSQL for document (graph) databases (Not-only-SQL), and SQL for
   relational (tabular) databases.
   #+end_quote
8) What's the top problem for data storage?
   #+begin_quote
   "Scaling": 3V (Volume, Velocity, Variety) definition of Big Data.
   #+end_quote
9) Could you tell the "smart home" case study after watching it?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Gather data using APIs for weather information (public), for
      tweets (commercial) and for sensor data (private).
   2) Transform data to fit a database format using e.g. [[https://airflow.apache.org/][Apache
      Airflow]]. 
   3) 
   #+end_quote
10) What does this case study illustrate?
    #+begin_quote
    The data pipeline: gather, transform, store data.
    #+end_quote
   
** Review test 1

1) You have loaded mtcars, saved ~mtcars~ in the variable data and loaded
   the ~Nile~ time series. What will ~ls()~ show in R?
2) What is the data science work flow?
3) Print the first 5 records of ~mtcars~

** (Systematic) introduction to R

- This and the lecture on data science in general are available via
  GitHub as PDF files.
