** Week 1 review

1. What is data science?
   #+begin_quote
   - Use data to better describe the present, predict or prescribe the
     future.
   - Interdisciplinary field that uses algorithms, data and math to
     extract insights from structured and unstructured data.
   - The "sexiest job of the 21st century"
   #+end_quote
2. Is the [[https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/elon-musk-shows-fsd-beta-v12-live-test-drive-on-x][Tesla test drive with Elon Musk]] (Aug 26, 2023) an example
   for a "data science application"? 
3. Describe the data science workflow.
   #+begin_quote
   1) Data collection and storage  [data import]
   2) Data preparation [data wrangling]
   3) Data exploration and visualization [data modeling]
   4) Experimentation and prediction [+ data storytelling]

4. What does 'deep learning' refer to?
   #+begin_quote
   A subfield of machine learning, which relies on large
   (i.e. multi-layered) neural networks.

   #+end_quote
5. Which job roles exist in data science and what do they mean?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Data wrangling: data engineer (SQL, cloud, Linux)
   2. Data analytics: data analyst (SQL, R, dashboards)
   3. Data modeling: data scientist (R, SQL, stats, machine learning)
   4. Deep learning: ML scientist (NLP, LLMs, Python > R)
   #+end_quote
6. Which ways do you know to program and run R?
   #+begin_quote
   - As a shell from the command line with ~R~ (or ~Rterm~)
   - As a REPL in replit.com (editor, console, terminal, PDF)
   - As an IDE with the command ~Rgui~ on your PC
   - As an IDE with RStudio on your PC or in the cloud
   - As an IDE in Emacs + ESS + Org-mode (advanced only)
   #+end_quote
7. What's special about R?
   #+begin_quote
   - Statistical programming language with great graphics
   - Open source and easy to expand
   - Easy to learn especially for non-technical people
   - Large community
   #+end_quote
8. Which R functions do you remember? (6)
   #+begin_example R
   data
   ls()
   help
   head
   plot
   q[uit]()
   #+end_example
9. What is the "formula" notation?
   #+begin_quote
   Refers to the use of ~~~ for x and y arguments in certain R functions
   like ~plot~ where you can call ~plot(x,y)~ or ~plot(y~x)~.
   #+end_quote
10. When can you connect the points in a scatterplot?
    #+begin_quote
    When the points are ordered in some way - for example when the
    data represent a time series (see ~Nile~).
    #+end_quote

** Week 2 preview

 - Datacamp Workspace: simple and extended example.
 - Exercise: import, view and plot the ~Nile~ data.
 - Lecture: What is data science?
