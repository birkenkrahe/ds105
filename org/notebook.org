   head
   plot
   q[uit]()
   #+end_example
9. What is the "formula" notation?
   #+begin_quote
   Refers to the use of ~~~ for x and y arguments in certain R functions
   like ~plot~ where you can call ~plot(x,y)~ or ~plot(y~x)~.
   #+end_quote
10. When can you connect the points in a scatterplot?
    #+begin_quote
    When the points are ordered in some way - for example when the
    data represent a time series (see ~Nile~).
    #+end_quote

** Week 2 preview

- Datacamp Workspace: simple and extended example.
- Exercise: import, view and plot the ~Nile~ data.
- Lecture: What is data science?

** Test 1 is live (complete by Sept 3, 11:59 pm)

- The test is available online, you've got 30 minutes
- It's an open book test: use any help you can get
- Gradebook in Canvas is updated automatically

* 2.1 Mon-28-Aug

- DataCamp review: data pipeline; job roles in data science
- Simple ~mtcars~ example in DataCamp workspace.
- Parameters in R functions, e.g. ~n~ in ~head(data, n=3)~.
- Plotting ~Nile~ data with ~plot(Nile)~ produces a line plot, choosing
  the parameter ~type="p"~ changes it to a scatterplot.
- Computing a trendline through points using ~lm~ (linear regression
  model), and drawing a colored line with ~abline~.

* 2.2 Wed-30-Aug

- For the first sprint review, try to identify a topic and/or a
  dataset, and work through the criteria of the Canvas assignment.
- ~plot()~ is an example of a 'generic function' - no matter what data
  structures or types you throw at it, it'll produce a plot.
- In DataCamp workspace, you can edit your notebook using Jupyter Lab:
  this gives you access to a launcher with file editor and a terminal;
  you can now create a .R file in the editor, and run it with ~Rterm~ in
  the terminal.
- The notebook has text cells, which allow insertion of links and
  images using markup notation.

* 2.3 Fri-1-Sep

We worked with the Workspace Demo file [[https://tinyurl.com/WorkspaceDemoR][tinyurl.com/WorkspaceDemoR]].

- How to download a CSV file to the PC
- How to establish an absolute or relative path to the file (on PC)
- How to read the CSV file into a data frame
- How to store the data frame in a variable
- How to check the structure of the data frame
- How to extract values from the data frame
- How to extract unique values from a column vector
- How to use the AI notebook interface

* 3.1 Wed-6-Sep

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1427/pages/sign-up-for-term-project][Sign up here!]]
- Another idea: DataCamp weekly datasets! ([[https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/overview][Example]])
  [[../img/weekly.png]]

** Review DataCamp session

1) What's an event log, for example for web data? How many features
   does it have?
   #+begin_quote
   An identifier, a description of the event, and a timestamp
   #+end_quote
2) Open your R scratchbook, load these data into a dataframe and tell
   me how many columns and rows the data have - use only ONE line
   after downloading the file: [[https://tinyurl.com/flightEventLogCsv][tinyurl.com/flightEventLogCsv]]
   #+begin_src R
     str(read.csv("../data/flight_event_log.csv",header=TRUE))
   #+end_src
3) What can you do with the Twitter API?
   #+begin_quote
   Extract tweets from Twitter for further analysis or to build an
   application - here are [[https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/][examples]] from the early days of X (2009).
   #+end_quote
4) Does OpenAI have an API? What could you do with it?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, and you could use it to get access to ChatGPT and build an AI
   application ([[https://platform.openai.com/overview][overview]]).
   #+end_quote
5) Are social network data quantitative or qualitative data?
   #+begin_quote
   Can be both: number of people logging in (quantitative), or
   sentiments expressed in a social media post (qualitative). For
   computational (=numerical) analysis, you need to convert
   qualitative into quantitative data.
   #+end_quote
6) Is a social network graph like shown below an example of
   quantitative or qualitative data?
   #+attr_latex: :width 400px
   #+caption: https://www-cdn.nebula-graph.io/nebula-website-5.0/images/blogs/nebulagraph-sns/graph-database-on-social-network-03.jpeg
   [[../img/social_network_graph.jpeg]]
   #+begin_quote
   Both! the node image represents a quality (type of account), while
   the graph itself represents a collection of nodes or vertices and
   edges or links, which can be represented as an edge list:
   [(1,2),(2,3)] means that node 1 is connected with node 2 and node 2
   is connected with node 3.
   #+end_quote
7) What languages do you use to query databases?
   #+begin_quote
   NoSQL for document (graph) databases (Not-only-SQL), and SQL for
   relational (tabular) databases.
   #+end_quote
8) What's the top problem for data storage?
   #+begin_quote
   "Scaling": 3V (Volume, Velocity, Variety) definition of Big Data.
   #+end_quote
9) Could you tell the "smart home" case study after watching it?
   #+begin_quote
   What's the goal? To collect data from various sources to analyze
   usage patterns, detect anomalies, make maintenance predictions.

   1) Gather data using APIs for weather information (public), for
      tweets (commercial) and for sensor data (private).
   2) Transform data to fit a database format using e.g. [[https://airflow.apache.org/][Apache
      Airflow]]: pulls data from all sources at regular intervals,
      cleans the data and loads it into a database.
   #+end_quote
10) What does this case study illustrate?
    #+begin_quote
    The data pipeline: gather, transform, store data, and the
    availability of infrastructure to help with these.
    #+end_quote

** Review test 1

1) You have loaded mtcars, saved ~mtcars~ in the variable ~data~ and
   loaded the ~Nile~ time series. What will ~ls()~ show in R?
   #+begin_src R :results output
     data(mtcars)
     data <- mtcars
     data(Nile)
     ls()
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "data"   "mtcars" "Nile"

2) What is the data science work flow?
   1) collect data
   2) prepare data (clean, storing)
   3) analyze (transform, visualize)
   4) share insights (present, notebooks)

3) Print the first 5 records of ~mtcars~
   #+begin_src R
     head(mtcars,n=5)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb

** Introduction to R

- This and the lecture on data science in general are available via
  GitHub as PDF files ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds105/tree/main/pdf][link]]) - you have to download the ~raw~ file.

- Summary:
  1) Different ways of opening and running R: notebooks (Google Colab,
     Kaggle, DataCamp workspace, notable.io), Rterm/Rgui, and
     different IDEs (RStudio, replit.com, vscode.dev).
  2) Installing R locally and setting the ~$PATH~ variable (with admin
     rights).
  3) Keeping different versions of R on your computer because of the
     dominance of libraries (which are tied to specific versions).
  4) R demo with ~demo()~, e.g. ~demo(graphics)~ and ~help.start()~
     documentation with tutorial and package list (local).

* No meeting on Sep-22 go to [[https://www.lyon.edu/acteb-conference][ACTEB]] instead!

Extra credit: get a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nya8YnjmXJRtSAi3VLCj-llfHgOie9RGd87rJ5H-YAI/edit?usp=sharing][signature]] from me for attending either the plenary
session (9am-12pm) of from a session chair (1-3 pm) for points!

Can't tell you not to go to other classes but if you have time
available, you should come to this conference to learn about AR's
economic future (AM) and hear research results in four concurrent
tracks on Economics, Education, Finance and Entrpreneurship (PM).

I'll be talking about "The Role of AI in Education". The concurrent
talks are very short (8-10 minutes with 1-2 minutes for questions).

A selection of interesting talks (judging from the title):
1) Economics: "Opportunity Costs of State Economic Development
   Spending: An Arkansas Case Study", Thomas Snyder (U Central AR)
2) Education: "The Role of AI in Education", Marcus Birkenkrahe (Lyon)
3) Finance: "Exchange-Traded Funds, Algorithmic Trading, and the
   Liquidity Illusion", Hannah Musso (U Central AR)
4) Entrepreneurship: "The Importance of Entrepreneurs is Growing",
   Terrance Farrier (UA Pine Bluff)
